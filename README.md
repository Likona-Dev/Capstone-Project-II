# Capstone-Project-II

## My Pygame

## Game Details:

### Description

This is a game written in the Python language, which uses the pygame library. This was created as a level 1 Capstone Project 
for the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in. An example pygame code was provided for me to modify
and build upon. In the game the player can move up and down with the arrow keys and must avoid colliding with the ‘enemy’ to win.

### Functionality

The game has a black background, One ‘player’ object. Which s able to move the player around the screen by using the up, down, left 
and right arrows.
The game has 3 ‘enemy’ objects. The enemies all move across the screen from different positions. If the player object collides with 
any enemy object, they lose and the game ends.
There is also 1 ‘prize’ object. If the player object collides with the prize object, they win, and the game ends.

### How can I use it?

Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Task Manager program and related text files to a local repository on your computer, 
so that you can access and run the program. If you need help, follow the instructions as set out github help webpage:

* https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

In order to run this game program, you will then need to install the Python interpreter program, and Pygame onto your computer's 
operating system (OS). Please use the website addesses below for assistance:

* https://www.python.org/downloads/ - Use this link to download the appropriate Python version for your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.).

* https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted - Use this link as a guide to using Python's Installer Program (PIP) to install Pygame.

Once you have finished installing Python and Pygame, you can view and run the code by accessing the IDLE program file that 
automatically downloads with the Python program files. This is an Integrated Development Environment which allows you to read and 
execute the code.

Double click on the IDLE program file to open it and a Python 'shell' window will appear. From here, you can click on the 'File' 
and 'Open' tabs on the top toolbar and navigate to the pygame program to open it. The program will then open in another window, 
separate to the Python shell.

**Make sure all the game asserts(images) are in the folder as the 'mygame.py' file. Otherwise when trying to run the game it will 
print out an error message.**

When you are ready to run the game, click 'run' on the toolbar above where the game code is displayed. The game screen will then 
appear and you can start moving the player!

### Contributions

The initial code was provided by Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp , for me to add on. 
The project was reviewed and commented on by the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp mentors.
